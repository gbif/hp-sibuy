In line with GBIF, SIBUy, as a national node, supports the publication of four classes of datasets using widely accepted biodiversity standards.

At the moment, only data from organizations are published directly. Individuals wishing to publish relevant datasets should do so through their organizations.

Participants in citizen science initiatives can indirectly publish their records by participating in one of the many projects around the world that publish their datasets through the GBIF network (e.g. eBird, NaturalistaUY).

# Securing institutional agreements

Once the decision has been made to share your data through SIBUy, the organization's coordinators should be advised of the plan to publish data on behalf of the institution. Sharing data through SIBUy and GBIF can increase the visibility and global impact of your institution, adding to traditional methods such as scholarly publications or specimen loans to uncover new opportunities for collaboration and, through the use of DOI-based citations, linked directly to research uses (example).

# Application for endorsement

In order to publish data, each organization must request the endorsement of the GBIF community. Once you have reviewed the data publication agreement and, in principle, agree to share data, we recommend that you request your organization's endorsement as soon as possible to avoid delays in data publication.

Selecting publishing tools and partners

Much of the data now shared with GBIF resides in one of the multiple facilities of the IPT: GBIF Integrated Publishing Tool and, increasingly, in national facilities of the Living Atlases platform originally developed by the Atlas of Living Australia.

Alternative arrangements, including data hosting, exist both within and outside a given publishing institution. Highly skilled publishers can also use an Application Programming Interface (API) to program the registration of datasets (contact the GBIF help desk for details).

We also have a knowledge base of additional tools and documentation.

# Prepare data for publication

Publishers who choose to share their data using Darwin Core Files (see data standards) can familiarize themselves with the format, using the spreadsheets created for datasets of occurrence records, taxonomic lists, and sampling events.

Using the updated version of the GBIF Data Validator, data sets can be reviewed prior to publication and will receive specific recommendations for cleaning and improving them. The report will help, for example, to flag duplicate records, incomplete fields and formatting inconsistencies.

Datasets can also be prepared directly to meet GBIF data quality requirements.

# Choosing a Creative Commons license

According to the GBIF 2014 Meeting of Governments decision, data publishers must assign one of three Creative Commons licenses to any dataset:

CC0, for data available for all uses without any restrictions.
CC BY, for data available for any use with appropriate attribution
CC BY-NC, for data available for all non-commercial uses with appropriate attribution

Note that CC-BY-NC licenses have a significant effect on the reusability of data. GBIF encourages publishers to choose the most open options whenever possible.

# Publishing datasets

If you are using an IPT to publish your dataset in GBIF, simply click on the 'Register' button. Once published, you can view some parameters relating to the dataset, (example), download activity (example) and citation tracking of literature received (example).

Incentives to publish open biodiversity data

An important part of GBIF's mission is to encourage recognition of the benefits of publishing biodiversity data in open access, both for the people who publish them and for society at large.

By making your data visible and accessible through GBIF and other similar information infrastructures, you contribute to global knowledge about biodiversity and thus to solutions that promote its conservation and sustainable use.
Publishing data enables the integration of datasets worldwide and reveals new opportunities for collaboration between data owners and researchers.
Publishing data allows recognition of the work, as creators and curators of biodiversity data, of individuals and institutions; giving visibility to the institutions that publish them, through appropriate documentation of metadata. This recognition can be further developed by publishing a peer-reviewed data article, which provides scientific recognition for the publication of biodiversity datasets.
Collection managers can track the use and citations of digitized data published from their institutions and accessed through GBIF and similar infrastructures.
Some funders now require researchers receiving public funding to make data accessible at the end of a project.
