Within the framework of the implementation of the National Strategy for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity, SIBUy seeks to integrate all general information on the country's biological collections through a national collections directory. This country tool is directly linked to the [Global Registry of Scientific Collections](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/es/){:target="_blank"} (GRSciColl), which is a community repository of information on scientific collections that expands on the work initiated by the Barcode of Life Consortium (CBOL) and is now coordinated and hosted by the Global Biodiversity Information System ([GBIF]([url](https://www.gbif.org/)){:target="_blank"}).

This catalog is a comprehensive, community-driven clearinghouse of information on the nation's biological collections. It provides information on physical scientific collections-their contents, location, contacts, partner institutions, and collection codes and identifiers. It offers information for a wide range of uses by experts, researchers, and members of society at large.

The collections listed in this national catalog can also automatically link the records published through SIBUy (GBIF Node) with the collection page. Thus, as they are also registered publishers (see [How to publish](/en/resources/manual-IPT/)) and have records available, identified in the Darwin Core field [*collectionCode*](/en/resources/darwin-core/#collectionCode) with the same identifier assigned in the catalog, it will be possible to integrate the general information of the collection together with the records available in the SIBUy and GBIF data portal.
