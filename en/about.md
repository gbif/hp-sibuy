## Biodiversity Data Portal of Uruguay

The Global Biodiversity Information Infrastructure ([**GBIF**](http://www.gbif.org/){: target="_blank"}), founded and funded by governments in 2001, is the world's largest multilateral initiative created to facilitate free access to biodiversity data via the Internet.

GBIF's mission is to promote and facilitate free and open access to biodiversity data worldwide through the Internet to support science, conservation and sustainable development. 

SIBUy is the node of **GBIF** in Uruguay. It is currently formed by the [**Ministry of Environment**](https://www.gub.uy/ministerio-ambiente/inicio){: target=“_blank”} and the [**National Museum of Natural History**](https://www.mnhn.gub.uy/){: target="_blank"}. 

## The objectives of the node are: 

1. To promote and encourage the mobilization of biodiversity data in the country.
2. To provide expertise in biodiversity data management and data quality improvement.
3. Promote the use of biodiversity data for scientific research and decision making. 
4. To foster collaboration among existing biodiversity-related initiatives, including the establishment of links with the regional and international GBIF network.


The Uruguay node in GBIF is part of the Latin American and Caribbean network, where we coordinate joint cooperation and training actions with countries in the region to promote the mobilization of biodiversity data.
