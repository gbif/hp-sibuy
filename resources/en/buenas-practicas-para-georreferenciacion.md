# Best practices for georeferencing

Locality data associated with biodiversity records are one of the fundamental components of research and various analyses based on these records, where spatial interpretation of the data is necessary. Good georeferencing of the data is necessary in order to make the best use of the record data. 

A poorly georeferenced locality obscures the information on which the georeference is based, potentially making the original information unrecoverable. This section therefore provides information on georeferencing best practices. While specifically aimed at biological occurrence data, the concepts and methods presented can be applied in other areas. It focuses especially on theoretical aspects of how to make spatially available data on the location of biodiversity-related phenomena, with special consideration for ecological and marine data.
