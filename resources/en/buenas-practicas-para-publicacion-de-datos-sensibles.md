# Best practices for publishing sensitive data

The unprotected distribution of sensitive species occurrence data (e.g. the exact localities of rare, endangered or commercially valuable taxa) was a concern of **GBIF** from its inception. The GBIF Secretariat has a strong interest in making data available through its portals, but at the same time respecting the wishes of data providers to restrict information on sensitive taxa.

In early 2006, **GBIF** initiated a process to address this issue, especially in relation to data that will be shared across the GBIF network and made visible through GBIF.org and other data aggregation initiatives. 

This document aims to provide best practices for dealing with sensitive species occurrence data, and to provide guidance on how to make as much data available as possible without at the same time opening up the species to harm because the data have been placed in the public domain.
