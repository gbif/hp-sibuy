# IPT (Integrated Publishing Toolkit) Manual

GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (**IPT**) is a freely available open source web application that facilitates the exchange of four types of biodiversity-related information: i) primary taxon occurrence data; ii) taxon checklists; iii) event data sampling; iv) general metadata on data sources. An instance of IPT, as well as the data and metadata recorded through IPT, are connected to the GBIF registry, indexed for query through the GBIF network and portal, and made available for public use.

This manual has three main components: 
1. an introduction with general information. 
2. A series of step-by-step tutorials and a complete reference guide including an 'introduction' section.
3. Sections describing in detail the different elements of the tool.
