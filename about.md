## Uruguayan Biodiversity Data Portal

The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) founded in 2001, is the world's largest multilateral initiative created to facilitate free access to biodiversity data through the Internet. GBIF's mission is to promote and facilitate free and open access to biodiversity data worldwide, through the Internet, in support of science, conservation and sustainable development. More information about GBIF is available at http://www.gbif.org/.

SIBUy is Uruguay's node in GBIF. It is currently comformed by the National Museum of Natural History, the Ministry of Environment, and Biodiversidata. 
The objectives of the node are: 
1.    To promote and foster the mobilisation of biodiversity data in the country.
2.    To provide expertise in biodiversity data management and data quality improvement.
3.    Promote the use of biodiversity data for scientific research and decision making. 
4.    To foster collaboration between existing biodiversity-related initiatives, including the establishment of links with the regional and international GBIF network.
 
The Uruguayan node in GBIF is part of the Latin American and Caribbean network, where we coordinate with countries in the region on joint cooperation and capacity building actions to promote the mobilisation of biodiversity data.
