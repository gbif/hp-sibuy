# Multiple types of tetrapod biodiversity *hotspots* and the challenges of scarcity of open access data

The uneven spatial distribution of biodiversity is a distinctive feature of nature. Indeed, the implementation of conservation measures both locally and globally has been progressively guided by the identification of biodiversity 'hotspots' (areas with exceptional biodiversity). However, different regions of the world differ drastically in the availability of fine-scale data on species diversity and distribution, limiting the possibilities for assessing their local environmental priorities. Within South America - a megadiverse continent - Uruguay represents a peculiar area where multiple tropical and non-tropical ecoregions converge, creating highly heterogeneous ecosystems, but where systematic quantification of biodiversity remains largely anecdotal. To investigate the constraints posed by limited access to biodiversity data, we used the most comprehensive database on tetrapod vertebrates of Uruguay (covering 664 species) collected to date to identify for the first time hotspots of species richness, endemism and threatened species. Our results reveal negligible spatial congruence among biodiversity hotspots, and that tetrapod sampling has historically been concentrated in a few areas. Taken together, our study provides a detailed account of areas where urgent monitoring efforts are needed to develop a more accurate understanding of biodiversity, providing government and environmental agencies with a critical scientific resource for future planning.
