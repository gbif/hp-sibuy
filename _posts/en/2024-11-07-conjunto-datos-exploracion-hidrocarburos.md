# New dataset: "Database of environmental, oceanographic and meteorological data generated in hydrocarbon exploration projects 2007-2017".

This database contains visual and acoustic detection events of marine mammals, sea turtles and one bird species conducted during different campaigns on board seismic survey vessels, exploratory drilling, or scientific campaigns in the Uruguayan Exclusive Economic Zone. 

The records cover a time frame between 2007 and 2017 and correspond to visual and acoustic detections carried out by Marine Megafauna Observers (MMOs) and Passive Acoustic (PAM) operators, respectively. 

Some of the main data contained in the database are: species names, coordinates of the record, type and behavior.
