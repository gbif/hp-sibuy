# Latin American request for the incorporation of languages other than English in the TDWG standards.

Historically, some of the most successful biodiversity data sharing initiatives have been developed particularly in North America, Europe and Australia. In parallel, and driven by need, tools, practices and standards were shared among other communities. In the last decade, countries in other regions have made great efforts to join the biodiversity data network and share their data worldwide. Although the knowledge, tools and documentation is widely distributed, language is the main limitation to its use, as most of it is only available in English. English may be the most widely spoken first language worldwide, but it is not native to the majority of the population, including a considerable proportion of the United States.  

While it is recognized that English is now considered the "universal language" for scientific activities, it has been pointed out that a large proportion of scientific knowledge on biodiversity is not produced in English and that language is a barrier to knowledge sharing. Actions to overcome this have been called for, for example in the list of ambitions to support international collaboration of the 2nd Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference (GBIC2), but are still largely lacking in the wider community.

Language affects the understanding and use of biodiversity data standards and related documentation for the entire community, both English and non-English speakers. Our findings in the Latin American region suggest that the availability of materials in other languages, i.e. Spanish and Portuguese, would greatly benefit the region and improve our participation in biodiversity data exchange. In addition, on the other hand, the English-speaking community would benefit from a better understanding of knowledge in languages other than English, allowing a wider use of data from all regions. This work also constitutes a plea from the Latin American and Spanish-speaking community in general to the Biodiversity Data Standards (TDWG) to explore and incorporate other languages, foster understanding and, therefore, expand the use of TDWG standards in our region.
