# Scientific publication with participation of researchers from Uruguay used data from GBIF

One of the most relevant uses of open data in the study of biodiversity is the use of species occurrence records to explain their current distribution and also to make future scenarios.

The study "Evaluating the suitability of puma (*Puma concolor*) habitat in Uruguay's grasslands: exploring source-sink dynamics and their implications for conservation" was recently published by researchers from the Universidad de la República.  

In this work, the main tool used were the Species Distribution Models to evaluate the habitat suitability of the puma in the study area, based on the records of presence of the species and environmental factors. The sources of these presence records were varied and included: bibliography, observations of researchers, scientific publications and data available through GBIF.
